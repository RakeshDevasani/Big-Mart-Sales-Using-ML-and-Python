8. Predicting sales of test dataset
# Insights
1. Top 5 sales are from same store(OUT027).
2. Least sales are mainly from stores OUT010 and OUT019 and all are from Grocery Stores(one of the reason could total stores of these stores are less).
3.  Medium size stores are more than others(may be we should consider increasing the high size stores to increase the sales).
4. Stores are mostly at tier 3 locations.
5. Most of the stores are of Supermarket Type1.
6. The sales and Item prices are linearly increasing but maximum item price just 266 only.So, we can't say this linear relation will be true for high price products.
7. Low Fat products have more sales.
8. Stores with big size have more sales.
9. Stores in urban area have more sales.
10. Supermarket Type3 have more sales.
11. Daily use products have high sales.
